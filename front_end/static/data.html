    <td>Glazer's has been great for professional support. I've gotten backpacks, hard to find Lee filters, studio lighting...all the tools for a great shot on the road or in studio. My latest purchase, an Elinchrom light kit, happened to have a bulb that was defective in the package. They sent me 2 bulbs immediately (arrived next day in Spokane) without charge. The lights are perfect for my needs, and they helped me select the softboxes I got (and their umbrellas) from the many models available. The prices are not that different from on line pricing, and it is worth it for the lessons, advice and direction from a professional. Their stores are well organized and well stocked. Such a difference from what we have in our town. CameraStore AudioVisualEquipment...</td>

They even let me take a couple cameras outside to see how they performed in natural light. The only somewhat negative vibe I got from the place was an unusual old man who was making jokes about the camera I bought being one of the ones that 'fell off the truck.' It was in very poor taste, but obviously not true, the sales girl gave him kind of an indulgent 'you're such a jerk' head shake and smiled at me. My recommendation is to go here and talk to the women, they have been wonderful! CameraStore AudioVisualEquipment...</td>

But I was also very impressed with the staff, food, lighting and seating. The theater area has one of the absolute best seating arrangements I have ever seen, no matter where you sit the view is great, I was seeing a double set and was able to sit in two very different locations. I have read a couple negative reviews about the food but ordered a few things and it was all fantastic. I had their pad thai and some chicken satay and a chocolate dessert. All of the food was great and the presentation impeccable, I plan to go back just for the chocolate dessert, unlike anything I have ever had and so very good. And this review is getting pretty long, so I will just say I had a great time and have no idea what the negative reviewers were talking about! Bar JazzClub ConcertHall</td>

    <td>Roland Ayala</td>
    <td>Glazer's is supposedly "the place to go" for camera gear in Seattle area but my experiences differ and I would recommend a friend against going there. In the process of deciding upon and purchasing a prosumer camera the sales experience felt hurried. While happy with the camera, I've come to discover things about the camera as informed by the salesperson that are flat out wrong or inaccurate. A significant selling point of buying from Glazers and the camera I ultimately chose (Sony A99) was the large availability of rental lenses -- as informed by salesperson. Only when I later called to rent a lens the first thing informed by the rental department was very low availability of Sony mount lenses, stating Sony is not a long established brand. In another incident I called my camera salesperson about availability of LED light kits. Again, I felt rushed and he encouraged me to visit the store because they have many LED lights available in stock. He referred me to their lighting person. I made the trip over from Eastside only to find they had very few models available, none of which worked for me (a very low-end, cheap consumer model and a couple very high-end / too large models). I ended-up going to Talls in Bellevue and they had exactly what I was looking for. Annoyed because Talls is much closer to me, I called Glazers and asked for the manager to describe my experience but got only voicemail. I left a message but Glazers has yet to call me back. (It's been a couple months now as I write this so safe to assume I'll never hear back.) It's fascinating to me that Talls -- a mall camera store -- has consistently given me far better service and information than the highly rated Glazers. It makes me wonder if Glazers is simply 'the cool' place to go among professionals and serious amateurs. Such associations are unimportant to me and I'd rather give my business to businesses that take the time to help me make well informed decisions, and that value my time and business. In my experience Glazers is not that place. CameraStore AudioVisualEquipment...</td>

At that time, we received an email from the company confirming they received our order, a summary of our order, a receipt for our purchase, and to let us know it was on it's way. 2 hours later we called, wondering where our order was, and they said we hadn't ordered anything for a month or two. I said, "Well then where did I get this email from you tonight at 6:22 with a full summary of my order and assurance it was on it's way?" He said, "Well we didn't get that." "What do you mean, 'we didn't get that'? I have the email from you right here in front of me!" He explained that they had been having some problems with their website and some orders weren't coming through. So we ended up getting our meal - over 3 hours after we ordered it - with not even an apology for being late. They were nice enough to take off $8.00 from our order. But that was hardly sufficient. I would have rather they gave me a sincere apology rather than the smug comments I got. I felt the phone rep was extremely rude, didn't seem to care at all that we had been waiting hours to eat, acted like it wasn't their fault, and offered little to help me other than he could try to get an order placed and sent over to me as soon as possible. It was an absolutely horrible experience. To make matters worse, we were FORCED to pay a 15% tip! Is it really a tip when it's compulsory???? Poor business practices, horrible delivery time, and very poor customer service. It seems that this company could care less about pleasing their customers.

I noticed I wasn't the only one bundled up and wearing a jacket. Everyone else there was too. You shouldn't have to wear a jacket in a restaurant. By the time I finished my sandwich and drink, I was back to shivering again. I wanted to stay and read for a little while while I waited for a friend. But even with a warm jacket on, it was still so unbearably cold that I just left and told my friend to meet me somewhere else.

    <td>The place was busy when I arrived. No seats available at the "track" so I sat in the booth. I got harassed a little because I was by myself, taking up a whole booth. But I wasn't going to sit elbow-to-elbow with other people right next to me. So there was no choice but the booth. They probably need to learn not to harass good paying customers. Aside from that, there were several things that bothered me. First, every 4th plate was sliced up pieces of watermelon. Not sure why there was watermelon in early March but whatever. The problem is that it looks almost exactly like slices of Tuna. Only AFTER you've pulled it off the belt do you realize that you're going to be eating FRUIT and not sushi. In general, there was WAY too much fruit on the track anyway. Blueberries, strawberries, Melons, and more. I came to eat Sushi and I don't mind having some fruit available too. But there was way too much Fruit and not enough Sushi. They had no Tuna on the entire track. So I had to ask for that. Which, in my opinion, is pathetic. That should always be out and available at a sushi place. No smoked salmon either. When I did ask for smoked salmon, I was provided with a plate of CHOPPED UP smoked salmon. Not quite how I usually get it at other places, but it did taste pretty good. I just don't like it all chopped up. It made it look like dog food. The tamago (egg omelet) was WAY too sweet. And I questioned if it was made there or came from a box. Because it looked manufactured, not made from scratch. And didn't taste much better either. Service was non existent. I would have taken another soda pop. But nobody ever came around to ask me if I wanted another. I would have liked to get a check. But after 5 minutes of waiting for someone to stop by and ask if I needed a check, I finally just walked away from my table, up to the counter. No service at all. Overall, not real impressed. But it was cheap. So I guess if you're looking for cheap - this is the place! SushiRestaurant JapaneseRestaurant</td>

    <td>We've been here several times. We were REALLY hoping we'd like this restaurant. Unfortunately, because of the food mainly, it's just mediocre. The atmosphere, I'd give it an A. Service, an A. Selection and taste of local beers, I'd give a B. But the food I would rate just a C. I've had both lunch and dinner there several times and I still have never really had a meal that I would consider gourmet. It was fresh, which I like. But the taste just wasn't there. I hate to say it, but they need a little better chef, a little better menu. More flavor. Seems like they try to hard to have unique combinations of food. But unique only works if it also tastes amazing. I wish their food was as good as everything else. Brewpub BanquetHall SteakHouse</td>

    <td>I have been hearing rave reviews from locals in this area for years. But in the 14 years or so that I have been working in this area off and on (as a contractor) I have never bothered to stop in. I have to say it looks pretty run down from the outside. So that was one big reason I never stopped in. But today I needed a quick lunch and there was nothing else up in this area so I decided to stop by. I was surprised at how quaint and clean the restaurant is inside. Much nicer than I thought it would be, judging by the way it looks outside. Very clean. Very quick service. Great burger. The buns were very fresh, the hamburger was fresh and just off the grill. The rest of the ingredients seemed and tasted very fresh too. It was packed busy at 1:00 p.m. so I guess I'm not the only person who liked the place. I would come back again - and bring some others with me. AmericanRestaurant HamburgerRestaurant</td>

But aside from not having a drivethrough (which I can handle) and aside from being a small restaurant (which I am okay with as well, since they keep it pretty nice inside), the worst thing is the bathroom situation. The restrooms are outside and freezing cold. The toilet and sink were clean. But the walls were dingy and the water was freezing cold in an already cold and unpleasant restroom. For this reason alone I rated them only 2 stars. If they had nice indoor restrooms I would give it 4 or 5 stars. FastFoodRestaurant AmericanRestaurant HamburgerRestaurant</td>

He was aloof and condescending. It was obvious that the driver was his buddy. On my next visit the guy at the counter was extremely rude and sarcastic. I've never seen such rude and ill-mannered employees at any restaurant. The guys who work here are arrogant jerks and they don't deserve your business or mine. FastFoodRestaurant SandwichShop</td>

Had fish and chips and tomato bisque with grilled cheese sandwich. Even though these dishes sound fairly plain, this restaurant's twist on then was nothing short of delicious and innovative. Even the coffee was gourmet. Unfortunately, the service was sub-par. We had to wait way to long to get our order in, too long for drinks, and service throughout the meal was slow or non-existent. This is unfortunate because everything else was A+. It wasn't really super busy so we couldn't figure out why service was so slow. Despite this, we both agreed that we'd definitely go back again. The food was worth it. I recommend this place highly, if only for the food and ambience. AmericanRestaurant</td>

No refills on drinks policy is pretty cheap and cheesy considering most all restaurants these days offer free refills. Overall, the restaurant was very small and run-down. Bathrooms outside and around the corner as if it was an old gas-station or something also gave me a very bad impression. The other thing that was pretty un-professional was the fact that they only take cash. You know who takes credit cards? Pretty much every restaurant in the world! Not sure why they don't here but it is kind of odd. I like the Tigard restaurant a little better but I probably wouldn't come back to this restaurant again. HamburgerRestaurant</td>

The Kung Pao tasted nothing like any Kung Pao I've ever had. The pineapple in the pineapple chicken was straight out of a can and the chicken tasted bad. They offered us fried rice or white rice with the meal. Unfortunately, I chose fried rice and it was nothing more than regular rice with soy sauce in it. It didn't look or taste anything like fried rice. I wish I could say something good about this place, but there honestly wasn't anything good about the experience.

First of all, they let you select from menus from all around your neighborhood and the prices are decent even though they do charge you a delivery fee (plus tip). I highly recommend following their Facebook page (or even taking a quick peak at it) before you order because they usually post coupons on a daily basis (I was able to get $5 off my order because of a coupon code found on Facebook!). The only downside is the food isn't piping hot when it gets to you, but that is heavily outweighed by the benefits of having something to order that isn't pizza or crappy chinese food.

It's got a used bookstore feel to it so you aren't clogged by the perfect lighting and layout that you find in places like Barnes and Nobles. Probably the only downside is that there isn't a lot of seating anywhere, but where could they put the chairs? This place is wall to wall books.
